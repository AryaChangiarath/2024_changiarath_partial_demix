Interfacial Tension Analysis of Biomolecular Condensates
This repository provides methods and tools for analyzing interfacial tension in biomolecular condensates formed through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). 
We investigate biomolecular condensates formed by three intrinsically disordered proteins:
    CTD (C-terminal domain of RNA Polymerase II)
    pCTD (phosphorylated CTD)
    HRD (Histidine Rich Domain)
Our simulations use the HOOMD-Blue software package with the residue-level hydropathy scale (HPS) model.
Key Objectives
    Determine interfacial tensions between different interphases in multiphasic systems.
    Interfacial tension with Dilute Phase: Measure the Interfacial Tension between the condensate and its dilute phases in the case of CTD and pCTD-HRD systems.
    Estimate the Interfacial tension between CTD and pCTD-HRD condensates within a multiphasic system.

Analysis Methods: Capillary wave theory is used to calculate interfacial tension by analyzing thermal fluctuations and measuring interfacial width in slab simulations.
